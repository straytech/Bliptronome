## Bliptronome

A Monome Clone conversion kit for the Thinkgeek Bliptronic 5000

This project from 2010 is available here for reference and is no longer maintained, though I'll be happy to answer questions about it!

####Description

This project allows you to convert a ThinkGeek Bliptronic 5000 synthesizer to a fully working “Arduinome” style open-source Monome Clone controller.

You will need a PCB or prototyping board, An FTDI (usb-to-serial) cable, programmable Atmega microcontroller or Arduino, potentiometers, ribbon cable, connectors, and related parts. You'll also need a ThinkGeek Bliptronic 5000.

Tools needed: Soldering iron, solder, screw driver, xacto-blade, and wire strippers (hot glue gun recommended).

The project takes about 2-5 hour building time for an intermediate builder, depending on the PCD construction.
