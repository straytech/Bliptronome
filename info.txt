  "ArduinomeFirmware" - Arduino Based Monome Clone by Owen Vallis & Jordan Hochenbaum 06/16/2008
  A translation of the 40h protocol designed by Brian Crabtree & Joe Lake, and coded by   Joe Lake.

Thanks to all of you & those who supported this in the forums & via email!

Additional Info:
I will be releasing conversion kits in the near future with all needed parts, pre-programmed atmega 328 chips, and extensive instructions.

For the "I know what I'm doing & I wanna Do it NOW!!!" folks:
-------------------------------------------------------------
any mini Arduino clone that uses an FTDI cable works best, or build your own with: 
Atmel Atmega 328 Microcontroller
16Mhz crystal
.1uf capacitor
6 pin FTDI pin header
small protoboard
Also: 
Ribbon cable to the controller (follow V2_PinConnections.jpg)
Ribbon Cable to 4 potentiometers (I used 5k pots-- outside solder lugs to 5V & GND, center solder lugs to A0-A4 pins on the Arduino)
8 x 10k resistors as per pin connections file

I put my board where the speaker used to be, with minimal plastic cutting for the FTDI header and to fit the board.

Flash the Bliptronome_V2.pde file to the controller
Flash the FTDI name to "a40h-5xx" using MProg.exe (See Arduinome build instructions)
Verify your Com Port is set to 57600
Use ArduinomeSerial to link via OSC or MIDI 
Set cable direction to "UP" or "TOP" (See Arduinome build instructions)
Send me a tune!
